# DSA with C++

This repository explores **Data Structures and Algorithms in C++**, featuring a collection of mini-projects inspired by classroom discussions and ideas discovered online. While the code may not be perfect, I hope it serves as a helpful reference and learning resource for anyone studying DSA â€” and makes the journey a bit more enjoyable!

## ðŸ§ª Compiling and Running

To compile and run any `.cpp` file in this project, use the following commands:

```bash
g++ sourcefilename.cpp -o exefilename
./exefilename
```

Replace `sourcefilename.cpp` with the file you want to run (e.g., `LinkedLists.cpp`), and `exefilename` with your desired output name.
